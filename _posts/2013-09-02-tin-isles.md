>An interpretation of a water-world setting for Savage Worlds in Plot Point Campaign form.

*This was intended to be a setting/adventure to run an RPG group through. We never got to it --- it's still only half finished. Books are hard.*

Sorry you don't get to see it, it's not even close to ready to show anyone outside of immediate friends.
