>Cards for 'random' character generation in Savage Worlds.

*I figured it would be interesting to randomly generate characters from cards. I ended up making a method to generated characters from a limited set of options (using cards).*

We got to test this in a zombie campaign. It worked *fairly* well. One person got a gimped character, another person got a hilarious character, and the rest were more-or-less normal.

I still need to find art and finish up the random items and generate some names, but it's released under CC-BY-SA-NC 3.0. If you want the files, you can give me a poke. It was made with a combination of Inkscape, InDesign, and CSVs.
