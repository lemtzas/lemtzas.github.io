> A quick AI for Tinted. It probabilistically mimics the player's actions.

*This was done for a class project that explores various AI techniques. This one in particular involved partitioning the possible states (as detected by probes, direction, and speed) and recording user responses. Then imitating the responses to solve the level.*

*It's interesting to watch it 'learn' as you go. Sometimes it can even finish with bad data. Try teaching it some tricks! It does loops fairly well.*
