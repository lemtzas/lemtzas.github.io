>*QtCooldown is an attempt to bring many features of the popular SexyCooldown and CoolLine addons for World of Warcraft into WildStar.  QtCooldown allows you to create up to six timelines on which you can display any of your currently active cooldowns as well as buffs or debuffs on yourself, your target, or your focus target.  By default, QtCooldown's timelines use a logarithmic scale, which means that timers which are expiring soon will move more quickly and are more spaced out than those with a long time remaining.  This allows you to quickly determine which abilities/auras will be ready soon even if there are many icons displayed on the bar.*

I performed some maintenance on an addon for the MMO Wildstar to keep it functioning after changes in Wildstar's API. The plugin appears to be used by ~500 players.

Shortly after I started playing Wildstar, one of my favorite plugins broke. The creator had already stopped playing Wildstar (and so stopped supporting the plugin), so I dropped instructions for a quick fix in the comments section and asked to be added as a maintainer. I was added and have worked in a couple updates since.
