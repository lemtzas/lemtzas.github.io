There don't seem to be many paper game jams, particularly online. Even while the video game jam scene is [so happening](http://compohub.net/). There were [over 20 concurrent jams](http://www.indiegamejams.com/) when I wrote this.

In my quest for a paper jam, most of what I found were somewhat specific contests ([like these on BGG](http://boardgamegeek.com/forum/974620/boardgamegeek/design-contests)), or in-person affairs.

So let's have an online jam for paper games.

Nothing but you, some paper, an optional theme, and a deadline.

Just make a game.

The first one will be this weekend. After that, I plan to host a 10-day version of this every 3 months, starting at the end of this next month. If there is enough interest, I may also host the 2-3 day version on other months. Let me know if you want to see that!

# What is a Game Jam?

In the [immortal words of wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_jam):

> A game jam is a gathering of game developers for the purpose of planning, designing, and creating one or more games within a short span of time, usually ranging between 24 and 48 hours. Game developers are generally made up of programmers, game designers, artists, and others in game development-related fields.

Often Jams have themes or restrictions. Ludum Dare is pretty popular, so I'll use it as an example. It's a solo, "from-scratch" 48-hour competition with an overlapping 72-hour jam with relaxed rules (allowing teams, prior code, etc) - the goal being to produce a game based on a theme, start-to-finish, within the allotted time. The entries are judged based on a variety of criteria including relevance to the given theme.

There's also 7-day-X events (7-day-roguelike, 7-day-FPS, etc) which challenges participants to make a specific kind of game in 7 days. There's even a "0 hour game jam" that takes place in the hour lost to daylight savings time. And "jams" that simply ask the participants to get something done and share it; no restrictions. And the [One Game a Month challenge](http://www.onegameamonth.com) that challenge people to produce one game each month for a full year.

Similarly, there are 10-day events that span 2 weekends. I've always found these to be the most accessible, so that's what I hope to build here. This first one will only be a single weekend, but I intend to have later ones span 2 weekends to minimize schedule conflicts and allow for a bit of playtesting before submission.

# The Details

**What:** An Online Paper Game Jam. Make a paper game, quick!

**When:** 4 days from now, on Friday, at 6PM PDT ([countdown](http://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/to?iso=20141003T06&p0=234&msg=Paper+Jam&csz=1&swk=1))

**How:** A thread will be made on [/r/tabletopgamedesign](http://reddit.com/r/tabletopgamedesign) at the start of the jam for discussion and directing submissions.

Get announcements from [@papergamejam](https://twitter.com/papergamejam). Discuss here or on [/r/paperjam](http://www.reddit.com/r/paperjam).

## When the Jam Starts

A theme and other optional goals will be announced at the start of the jam. Try to do them if you can. If you can't, don't worry about it. This is about making a game and having some fun.

For this Jam, you'll have 48 hours to complete a game. There are no restrictions, just some suggestions. You may use any materials you like. Though keep in mind that a game that's hard to assemble is less likely to be played.

Upload your game as a PDF to Dropbox, Google Drive, or some other hosting service and submit it to the Submissions Thread with the requested information. The thread will be in Contest Mode for a week for everyone to try and vote on their favorite games.

Good luck and have fun!

## Recommended Materials

In order to keep the games as accessible as possible, I've come up with a list of materials I believe are common enough that most jammers should have access to them.

* 1-4 Players
* 12-36 Dice (36-12mm dice or 12-18mm)
* Standard Dice Set (d4, d6, d8, 2d10, d12, d20)
* A standard 54-card deck
* 50 tokens in 4 varieties (coins, glass counters, or chits from another game)
* Mono-color Printer & Paper (try to keep ink use low)
* Scissors
* Pen (single color)
* Stapler, Glue, or Tape?
* Generic PnP Fiddly Bits (Work in Progress) ([the pdf](http://puu.sh/bRltq/bd287b0317.pdf) and [the bits, assembled](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Byoi59YCUAEtpI1.jpg:large))
    * 10 Pawns
    * 70 tokens
    * under 10 minute assembly time

If there are any bits you don't have access to, or any bits you really wish you could use, let me know! The list is tentative. 

## Useful Software and links

* Inkscape
* Google Docs
* [Open Game Art](http://opengameart.org)
* *Tell me about more to add.*
