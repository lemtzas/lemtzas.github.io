>A quick stat generation script for Savage Worlds rolls.

*I made this to get a better idea of the probabilities of success (and various degrees of success) in Savage Worlds, as they are fairly complicated.*

As a result, I discovered a mildly concerning quirk of having both exploding dice (rolling the max die value means you re-roll and sum the two die, as many times as you roll the max die value) and varying die size --- If you roll a die the size of your Target Number, you have a slightly **worse** chance (less than 2% worse) of success than if you rolled a die the size of TN--2. Meaning that what the game sets up to be 'improvement' might be...less so.
